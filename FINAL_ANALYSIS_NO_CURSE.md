## The Grammy Predictions Tradition

Since 2020, I've run an annual Grammy predictions survey with my friends. This year, 30 people participated, voting on who they think will win each major category. I give a gift card to whoever gets the most correct - it's become a fun way to see who really understands the pulse of pop culture.

Every year, the Best New Artist category sparks the same debate: is winning this award actually a good thing? The "Best New Artist curse" is music industry folklore - the idea that winning dooms your career. People point to Fun (broke up shortly after), Macklemore & Ryan Lewis (disappeared after their viral moment), and various one-album wonders as proof.

But I wanted to know: **is this actually true, or just confirmation bias?**

So I spent 350 hours collecting data on 65 Best New Artist winners across 68 years (1958-2026) to test it.

## What I Found

**The Best New Artist curse doesn't exist.**

At least not in the way people think. Looking at peak chart performance - the best position artists achieved before versus after their Grammy win - there's no statistical evidence of a curse.

**The data:**
- **67.9%** of winners hit Top 10 on Hot 100 AFTER their Grammy (up from 56.6% before)
- **61.0%** hit Top 10 on Billboard 200 AFTER their Grammy (up from 42.4% before)
- More winners hit #1 albums after Grammy (8 artists) than before (4 artists)
- No statistically significant decline in peak positions for singles (p=0.35) or albums (p=0.05)

**Translation:** Most winners maintain or improve their peak chart performance after winning. The curse is folklore, not fact.

## Methodology

**What I analyzed:**
- 65 Best New Artist winners (1960-2026)
- 2,526 Billboard chart entries
- Both Hot 100 (singles) and Billboard 200 (albums)
- Peak chart positions before vs after Grammy win
- Quarterly sampling: 4 dates per year (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct)
- Time window: 5 years before win → 10 years after

**Why peak positions?**  
I wanted to know if winners could still release hit music - not whether they sustained constant visibility. A #1 album is a #1 album, whether it happens the year of the Grammy or five years later.

**Missing artist:**  
Samara Joy (2023 winner) has never charted on Hot 100 or Billboard 200. She's a jazz artist - proof you can win Best New Artist through critical acclaim without mainstream commercial chart presence.

**Fun fact I discovered:**  
Olivia Dean, the 2026 Best New Artist winner, has the middle name Lauryn - named after Lauryn Hill, who won Best New Artist in 1999. Dean was born in 1998, the year Hill's "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" dominated. A full-circle Grammy moment.

**Note on Best New Artist:**  
This award recognizes breakthrough moments, not debuts. Many winners had been releasing music for years before their "breakthrough" moment. Bon Iver won for his second album. Chance the Rapper had multiple mixtapes out. The Grammy marks when an artist breaks through to mainstream awareness, not when they start their career.

## The Success Stories

### Adele: Peak Performance After Grammy

Adele won Best New Artist in 2009 for her album "19."

**Chart performance:**
- Peak before Grammy: #41 (Billboard 200)
- Peak after Grammy: **#1** (Billboard 200)

Her best albums - "21" and "25" - both hit #1 and came AFTER her Grammy win. If there's a curse, she didn't get the memo.

### The Beatles: Sustained Excellence

The Beatles won in 1965 at the height of Beatlemania.

**Chart performance:**
- Peak before Grammy: #1 (both charts)
- Peak after Grammy: #1 (both charts)

They maintained #1 performance on both singles and albums after winning. Zero curse effect.

### Billie Eilish: Minimal Decline, Still Elite

Billie Eilish swept the major categories in 2020.

**Chart performance:**
- Singles: #3 before → #6 after
- Albums: #3 before → #4 after

She showed small declines in peak position, but she's still producing Top 5 albums and Top 10 singles. "Birds of a Feather" hit #6 in 2024 and was still charting in early 2025. If this is a curse, it's pretty mild.

### More Success Stories

**Chance the Rapper:**
- Singles: #63 before → **#2** after (massive improvement)

**Natalie Cole:**
- Singles: #40 before → **#9** after
- Albums: #70 before → **#12** after

**John Legend:**
- Singles: #31 before → **#2** after

**Whether looking at singles or albums, many winners either maintained or improved their peak performance after the Grammy.**

## Why Do People Believe the Curse?

### Confirmation Bias

We remember the failures more than the successes. Fun breaking up, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis disappearing after their viral moment - these stories stick.

Even Fun complicates the curse narrative though: Jack Antonoff, the band's guitarist, went on to become one of the most dominant producers in music. He's won Producer of the Year multiple times and produced Grammy-winning work for Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar, and countless others. The band may have dissolved, but its members didn't disappear.

For every Macklemore who faded, there's an Adele or Beatles or Mariah Carey or Alicia Keys who went on to massive success.

### The Failures Have Other Explanations

When I looked at the artists people cite as curse victims, most had specific circumstances that explain their decline.

**Fun** broke up shortly after winning in 2013. Their singles peak went from #1 ("We Are Young") to #14 post-Grammy. The band dissolved - but Jack Antonoff, their guitarist, went on to become one of the most dominant producers in music. He's won Producer of the Year multiple times and produced Grammy-winning work for Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar, and countless others. The band failed, but its members didn't.

**Macklemore & Ryan Lewis** had a massive cultural moment with "Thrift Shop" (#1 in 2013), won Best New Artist in 2014, then seemingly disappeared. Their best post-Grammy single only hit #16. They were a viral phenomenon - the kind of lightning-in-a-bottle moment that's nearly impossible to replicate.

These aren't curses. They're natural career arcs - some artists peak early, some sustain, some reinvent. The Grammy didn't determine which path they took.

### Natural Career Cycles

Staying at #1 forever is hard. Most artists have peaks and valleys. The data shows that winners can and do produce #1 albums and Top 10 singles after their Grammy win - they just might not do it every single time.

## What About the Artists Who Did Decline?

Yes, some winners showed peak declines. About 47% of winners on Hot 100 and 42% on Billboard 200 had worse peak positions after their Grammy.

That means 53% maintained or improved singles peaks, and 58% maintained or improved album peaks.

More winners succeed than fail. The curse narrative focuses on the minority.

## Limitations

I want to be transparent about what this analysis doesn't capture:

**Quarterly sampling:**  
I sampled 4 dates per year rather than every week. This captures major hits but misses songs that charted briefly at lower positions. Testing showed this captures about 75% of chart appearances - all the hits are there, but some deep cuts are missing.

**No Spotify data:**  
The Spotify API has been down during this project. Streaming data would provide modern commercial success metrics, especially for post-2010 artists. Chart positions and streaming success don't always align.

**Pre-streaming era bias:**  
Most of the dataset (55 of 65 artists) is from 1960-2010. Chart dynamics changed significantly with streaming - singles became more important, album sales declined. The patterns I found might not hold exactly the same way for artists who debuted in the streaming era.

**No control group:**  
I only analyzed winners. Comparing to Best New Artist nominees who lost would show whether winning causes anything or if breakthrough artists in general face similar trajectories. (This is on my list for a future analysis.)

**Peak positions don't show everything:**  
An artist who hits #1 once then disappears looks the same as an artist who hits #1 and sustains a long career. Peak positions measure ceiling, not consistency or longevity.

**This was my first web scraping project:**  
I learned a lot along the way. There were bugs (Olivia Rodrigo's file corrupted three times), formatting issues (artist names with ampersands), and slow progress (300+ hours of overnight scraping sessions). But I got there.

## What I Learned (Beyond the Data)

**The technical stuff:**  
Going from not knowing how to scrape to building a system that collected 2,526 data points across 65 artists over 68 years was challenging. I learned Python web scraping, error handling, data validation, and how to keep myself awake while code runs overnight.

**The surprising part:**  
I genuinely expected to find evidence of a curse. The folklore is so debated that I assumed there had to be something to it. Finding that winners actually hit Top 10 MORE after their Grammy was unexpected.

**The exciting part:**  
I woke up every morning excited to check the progress - watching the dataset grow from 10 artists to 41 to 65 felt like watching a hypothesis come to life.

**The frustrating part:**  
Artist name formatting. "Crosby, Stills & Nash" vs "Crosby, Stills and Nash" caused duplicate files and hours of debugging. Whoever designed the billboard.py library: ampersands are valid characters, please don't make me regret using them.

**What I'd do differently:**  
If I started over, I might focus on peak positions from the beginning instead of exploring multiple metrics. However, the exploration taught me why peaks matter more than averages for this question.

## Conclusion

After analyzing 68 years of Grammy winners and 2,526 Billboard chart entries, I found no statistical evidence that winning Best New Artist hurts careers.

**What the data shows:**
- Most winners maintain or improve peak chart performance
- More winners hit Top 10 AFTER their Grammy
- Success stories outnumber failures
- Failures often have explanations unrelated to the Grammy

**What people believe:**
- Winning Best New Artist dooms your career
- The curse is real and documented
- Winners fade into obscurity

**The gap between belief and data is significant.** The Best New Artist curse is folklore, not fact. We're wired to remember the dramatic failures - the scandal, the one-hit wonder, the band that broke up. The consistent successes fade into background noise, even when they outnumber the failures.

**For my Grammy predictions survey:** At least I can rest assured that my favorite artists aren't doomed by winning. Chappell Roan won in 2026 - turns out she'll probably be fine.
