# testing the best new artist curse: what 68 years of data actually shows

since 2020, i've run an annual grammy predictions survey with my friends. this year, 30 people participated - we vote on who we think will win each major category, and i give a gift card to whoever gets the most right. it's become this tradition that shows who's in tune with the pulse of pop culture and who's just guessing based on vibes.

every year, the best new artist category sparks the same debate: is winning this award actually a good thing? the "best new artist curse" is music industry folklore - the idea that winning dooms your career. people point to fun. (broke up shortly after), macklemore & ryan lewis (disappeared after their viral moment), and various one-album wonders as proof.

if you google "grammy best new artist curse," you'll find vanity fair articles, variety explainers, rolling stone retrospectives - all recycling the same narrative. every february, publications dust off the same 4-5 examples from the '70s-'90s: starland vocal band, milli vanilli, arrested development.

the story is everywhere. everyone "knows" it's real.

except... what if we actually tested it with data?

i wanted to know: is this actually true, or just confirmation bias?

so i spent 350 hours collecting data on 65 best new artist winners across 68 years (1958-2026) to test it. this is my first real dive into music data analysis, and it became both a personal curiosity project and the inaugural post in what we're hoping becomes a series exploring music through data at moonpath.

## what i found

the best new artist curse doesn't exist.

at least not in the way people think. looking at peak chart performance - the best position artists achieved before versus after their grammy win - there's no statistical evidence of a curse.

**the data:**
- <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">67.9%</span> of winners hit top 10 on hot 100 after their grammy <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">(up from 56.6% before)</span>
- <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">61.0%</span> hit top 10 on billboard 200 after their grammy <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">(up from 42.4% before)</span>
- more winners hit #1 albums after grammy <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">(8 artists)</span> than before <span style="color: #D94F4F;">(4 artists)</span>
- no statistically significant decline in peak positions for singles (p=0.35) or albums (p=0.05)

most winners maintain or improve their peak chart performance after winning. the curse is folklore, not fact.

## what i'm testing (and what i'm not)

**what this analysis measures:** chart performance - whether winners could still release hit music after their grammy.

**what it doesn't measure:** 
- band breakups
- personal tragedies
- career longevity
- critical acclaim
- cultural impact

some articles cite the beatles as "cursed" because they broke up in 1970, five years after winning. but their chart performance never declined - they maintained <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">#1 hits</span> until they disbanded.

the "curse" narrative mixes together different kinds of outcomes:
- **chart decline** (what i'm measuring)
- **band breakups** (fun., the beatles)
- **scandals** (milli vanilli)
- **personal struggles** (lauryn hill, amy winehouse)
- **one-hit wonders** (starland vocal band)

i'm testing one specific claim: **does winning best new artist hurt your ability to chart hit music?**

the answer: no. <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">67.9%</span> of winners hit top 10 after their grammy, up from <span style="color: #D94F4F;">56.6%</span> before.

bands break up for lots of reasons. artists face personal struggles. some have short careers regardless of awards. but the data shows winning best new artist doesn't doom your chart performance.

## the success stories

### adele

adele won best new artist in 2009 for her album "19."

**chart performance:**
- peak before grammy: <span style="color: #D94F4F;">#41</span> (billboard 200)
- peak after grammy: <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">#1</span> (billboard 200)

her best albums - "21" and "25" - both hit #1 and came after her grammy win.

### the beatles

the beatles won in 1965 at the height of beatlemania. they maintained <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">#1 performance</span> on both singles and albums after winning. yes, they broke up in 1970 - but their chart performance never declined.

### maroon 5

maroon 5 won in 2005. before their grammy, they had <span style="color: #D94F4F;">3 charting singles</span> with a peak of <span style="color: #D94F4F;">#6</span>. after? <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">18 charting singles</span> including two that hit <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">#1</span> ("moves like jagger" and "one more night").

### billie eilish

billie showed small declines in peak position (singles: <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">#3</span> before → <span style="color: #D94F4F;">#6</span> after, albums: <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">#3</span> → <span style="color: #D94F4F;">#4</span>), but she's still producing top 5 albums and top 10 singles. "birds of a feather" hit #6 in 2024 and was still charting in early 2025.

whether looking at singles or albums, many winners either maintained or improved their peak performance after the grammy.

## why do people believe the curse?

### publications have been recycling the same story for 50 years

every grammy season, music publications publish some version of "is the best new artist curse real?" or "is the curse finally over?"

they cite the same artists:
- **starland vocal band (1977)** - broke up, band member called it "the kiss of death"
- **milli vanilli (1990)** - scandal, award rescinded
- **arrested development (1993)** - one album wonder
- **a taste of honey (1979)** - faded after one hit

these 4-5 dramatic failures from the '70s-'90s get mentioned in every article. meanwhile, 40+ sustained careers get ignored.

the narrative survives because it's a better story than "most winners do fine."

### we remember the dramatic failures

fun. broke up shortly after winning in 2013. their singles peak went from <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">#1</span> ("we are young") to <span style="color: #D94F4F;">#14</span> post-grammy. the band dissolved - but jack antonoff, their guitarist, went on to become one of the most dominant producers in music. he's won producer of the year multiple times and produced grammy-winning work for taylor swift, kendrick lamar, and countless others. the band failed, but its members didn't.

macklemore & ryan lewis had a massive cultural moment with "thrift shop" (<span style="color: #6BBF6B;">#1</span> in 2013), won best new artist in 2014, then seemingly disappeared. their best post-grammy single only hit <span style="color: #D94F4F;">#16</span>. they were a viral phenomenon - the kind of lightning-in-a-bottle moment that's nearly impossible to replicate.

natural career arcs. some artists peak early, some sustain, some reinvent. the grammy didn't determine which path they took.

### the psychology of it

we're wired to remember the dramatic failures - the scandal, the one-hit wonder, the band that broke up. the consistent successes fade into background noise, even when they outnumber the failures.

about <span style="color: #D94F4F;">47%</span> of winners on hot 100 and <span style="color: #D94F4F;">42%</span> on billboard 200 had worse peak positions after their grammy. that means <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">53%</span> maintained or improved singles peaks, and <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">58%</span> maintained or improved album peaks.

more winners succeed than fail. the curse narrative focuses on the minority.

## the "curse is over" narrative misses the point

recent articles claim the curse has "finally ended" because billie eilish, olivia rodrigo, and megan thee stallion succeeded after winning.

but the curse didn't "end" recently. **it never existed.**

winners from every era succeeded:
- **adele** won in 2009 (<span style="color: #D94F4F;">#41</span> → <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">#1</span>)
- **mariah carey** won in 1991 (massive success, 19 #1 hits total)
- **the beatles** won in 1965 (maintained <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">#1 performance</span>)
- **maroon 5** won in 2005 (<span style="color: #D94F4F;">3 songs</span> → <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">18 songs</span>, including two <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">#1 hits</span>)

recent winners didn't "break" the curse - they just made us pay attention to what the data showed all along.

## how i did this

**what i analyzed:**
- 65 best new artist winners (1960-2026)
- 2,526 billboard chart entries
- both hot 100 (singles) and billboard 200 (albums)
- peak chart positions before vs after grammy win
- quarterly sampling: 4 dates per year (jan, apr, jul, oct)
- time window: 5 years before win → 10 years after

**why peak positions?**  
i wanted to know if winners could still release hit music - not whether they sustained constant visibility. a #1 album is a #1 album, whether it happens the year of the grammy or five years later.

**missing artist:**  
samara joy (2023 winner) has never charted on hot 100 or billboard 200. she's a jazz artist - proof you can win best new artist through critical acclaim without mainstream commercial chart presence.

**fun fact:**  
olivia dean, the 2026 best new artist winner, has the middle name lauryn - named after lauryn hill, who won best new artist in 1999. dean was born in 1998, the year hill's "the miseducation of lauryn hill" dominated. a full-circle grammy moment.

## what i learned

this was my first web scraping project. i woke up every morning excited to check the progress - watching the dataset grow from 10 artists to 41 to 65 felt like watching a hypothesis come to life.

the surprising part: i genuinely expected to find evidence of a curse. the folklore is so debated that i assumed there had to be something to it. finding that winners actually hit top 10 <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">more</span> after their grammy was unexpected.

this project also taught me how narratives spread without fact-checking. publications cite each other's articles, which cite older articles, creating a self-referential loop. the "curse" became "true" through repetition, not evidence.

i found myself falling for it too - i expected to find a curse because i'd read so many articles about it. confirmation bias works on everyone, including people actively trying to test for it.

## limitations

**quarterly sampling:**  
i sampled 4 dates per year rather than every week. this captures major hits but misses songs that charted briefly at lower positions.

**no spotify data:**  
the spotify api has been down during this project. streaming data would provide modern commercial success metrics, especially for post-2010 artists.

**pre-streaming era bias:**  
most of the dataset (55 of 65 artists) is from 1960-2010. chart dynamics changed significantly with streaming.

**no control group:**  
i only analyzed winners. comparing to best new artist nominees who lost would show whether winning causes anything or if breakthrough artists in general face similar trajectories.

**peak positions don't show everything:**  
an artist who hits #1 once then disappears looks the same as an artist who hits #1 and sustains a long career. peaks measure ceiling, not consistency or longevity.

## what this means

after analyzing 68 years of grammy winners and 2,526 billboard chart entries, i found no statistical evidence that winning best new artist hurts **chart performance**.

music publications have recycled the curse narrative for 50 years, but they mix together different outcomes:
- chart decline (adele went <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">up</span>)
- band breakups (the beatles broke up but maintained <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">#1 performance</span>)
- scandals (milli vanilli's award was rescinded)
- personal struggles (amy winehouse, lauryn hill)

these are different phenomena. the data addresses one specific claim: **does winning hurt your ability to release hit music?**

**the data:**
- <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">67.9%</span> hit top 10 after winning <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">(up from 56.6%)</span>
- <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">2x more artists</span> hit #1 albums after winning
- <span style="color: #6BBF6B;">53%</span> maintained or improved singles peaks

**what the curse ISN'T:**
- a guarantee of longevity (some careers are naturally short)
- protection against band breakups (creative differences happen)
- immunity from personal struggles (unrelated to the award)

the gap between data and narrative is significant. publications cite the beatles as "cursed" because they broke up - but they never stopped charting #1 hits. they cite fun. because the band dissolved - but jack antonoff became producer of the year. they cite amy winehouse who died tragically - but her chart performance was stellar.

the best new artist award doesn't doom your chart performance. chappell roan won in 2025. based on 68 years of data, her ability to release hit music is just fine.

## what's next: testing "better to lose than win"

articles love pointing out that taylor swift, kacey musgraves, and paramore all **lost** best new artist and went on to massive careers.

the implication: maybe it's better to lose than win.

phase 2 would test this directly by comparing winners vs. nominees who lost:

**matchups:**
- **amy winehouse** (won 2008) vs. **taylor swift** (lost)
- **macklemore & ryan lewis** (won 2014) vs. **kendrick lamar** (lost)
- **fun.** (won 2013) vs. **frank ocean** (lost)

this would answer: does **winning** cause anything, or do breakthrough artists just follow natural career arcs regardless of who takes home the trophy?

estimated effort: 20-30 hours scraping 30-50 additional artists.

this would turn a good analysis into a definitive one that directly challenges the "better to lose" narrative.
